                Perfect consonances: unison, fifth, octave; intervals made of these and the octave. Imperfect consonances: sixth, third; intervals made of these and the octave. The fourth is debated: some consider it a perfect consonance, others a dissonance (do any consider it an imperfect consonance? Do all the sources that follow Fux also have his "sometimes consonant, sometimes dissonant"?). All others are dissonant.
                <p>Unison, third, fifth, sixth, octave, and the intervals made up of these and the octave are consonances. Some of these are perfect consonances, the others imperfect. The unison, fifth, and octave are perfect. The sixth and third are imperfect. The remaining intervals, like the second, fourth, diminished fifth, tritone, seventh, and the intervals made up of these and the octave, are dissonances.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#4.1">[4.1]</a></sup></p>
                <p>In an earlier chapter, Fux distinguishes between the fourth obtained from the arithmetical division of the octave and that deriving from the harmonic division... In the first case, where the lower tone of the fourth is at the same time the fundamental tone—that is, in every instance when dealing with two voices—the fourth is considered a dissonance. In the second case its dissonant character is invalidated by the new fundamental tone, and it can be considered an imperfect consonance... In classifying the fourth among the dissonances, Fux makes his decision with regard to what he calls "a famous and difficult question." Martini, basing his opinion upon that of Zarlino (<cite>Institutioni Harmoniche</cite>, Part III, ch. 5), goes so far as to call the fourth a perfect consonance (<cite>Esemplare</cite>, pp. xv and 172). Hadyn and Beethoven follow Fux. Mozart (<cite>Fundamente des General-Basses</cite>, p. 4) also lists the fourth as a dissonance.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#4.2">[4.2]</a></sup></p>
                <p>The consonant intervals are the P1, m3, M3, P5, m6, M6, and P8. All other intervals within the octave are considered dissonant.<sup class="footnote"><a href="#5.1">[5.1]</a></sup></p>
                <p>From a perfect consonance (P1, P5, P8) to an imperfect consonance (M3, m3, M6, m6, M10, m10)...<sup class="footnote"><a href="#5.2">[5.2]</a></sup></p>
